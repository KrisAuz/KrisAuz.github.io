            <img src="img/kevo.jpg"></p>
            Ever wanted to unlock the door by nothing, but the touch of your hand? Well now you can! Kevo by Kwikset is a smart lock which utilises Bluetooth – the technology almost every one of us have in our Smartphones. Pair your smartphone with the lock and you will be able to lock and unlock the door by the touch of your hand, as long as your phone is in near proximity – pocket or purse for example.</p>
            You can even share your key with other smartphones and revoke access later – if your relatives are staying over and you have to be at work. Simply share the key with their smartphones – no more last minute key-cutting.
            Don’t have a smartphone? Don’t worry, Kevo also offers a specialised key fob for the same key-less touch entry feature.</p></p>
            For the times when your smartphone’s battery dies before the end of the workday, there’s still the same old traditional key option available.</p>

            <h3>Features:</h3>
            <ul class="list">
              <li>Kevo is equipped with high standard Public Key Infrastructure encryption and features intelligent positioning technology to determine whether the user is inside or outside the building</li>
              <li>Kevo uses Kwikset’s deadlock SmartKey technology which is well-known for its security and has passed UL 437, par. 11.6 lock picking tests</li>
              <li>Supports most iOS and Android devices</li>
            </ul>

        First of all the product articles would be posted on company's social media, such as Twitter, Facebook etc. to inform followers. This might also gain likes, shares, and retweets from the original equipment manufacturers spreading the LocksOnline name. </br>
        Articles could also be posted on relevant forums and blogs, which allow direct guest posting.</br>
        Equipment manufacturers might also have blogs or review articles. Articles from LocksOnline could be published there with backlinks to LocksOnline (if allowed).</br>
        Backlinks could also be acquired from recommendation or Q&A sites such as Quora. If a user there asks for a recommendation on a product/similar products, small answer could be given there with a source linking back to LocksOnline.</br>
        Traffic could also be acquired by adding information to relevant Wikipedia pages and referencing the source with a link to LocksOnline articles.</p>
